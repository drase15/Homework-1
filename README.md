## Homework Week 1

Instrument assignment:

This is rather interesting, as they are using the motion of water to create sound using arduino and a program called ChucK. it appears an inductor is placed in the water, and somehow transmitts the water vibrations to the computer.

IR Sensor
Used to detect infrared light that is not visible to the human eye, but is used by remotes for televisions, and the signal can indicate different functions.

Tilt Sensor
Very simple a cylinder with mercury or a ball inside, when it is flipped the sensor tells the system that the orientation is now reversed.

Photocells
As shown in class, they detect variations in light, and are rather sensitive. They can be used in applications not just is light present, but is something blocking light from getting to me.


## Homework 2

Using the Robotic Arm, I am wanting to paint a three dimensional surface with electrical circut paint. When an individual touches the curves, it makes a note corresponding to the width of the curve. Thicker lines will produce a lower pitch and thinner lines will produce higher. The arduino and power source will be inside the surface, and attached to the curves on the exterior.

Whenever the electrical paint is touched, it sends a signal to the arduino that it is being touched, and to play a corresponding note. I am not yet informed what sensor picks up on this, but I am assuming it is a touch sensor or a sensor that detects human skin touch.
