This is rather interesting, as they are using the motion of water to create sound using arduino and a program called ChucK. it appears an inductor is placed in the water, and somehow transmitts the water vibrations to the computer.

IR Sensor
Used to detect infrared light that is not visible to the human eye, but is used by remotes for televisions, and the signal can indicate different functions.

Tilt Sensor
Very simple a cylinder with mercury or a ball inside, when it is flipped the sensor tells the system that the orientation is now reversed.

Photocells
As shown in class, they detect variations in light, and are rather sensitive. They can be used in applications not just is light present, but is something blocking light from getting to me.
